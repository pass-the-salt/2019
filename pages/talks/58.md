## Reversing a Firmware uploader & others NFC stories
---


In this presentation, I explore how to approach a closed source firmware uploader, how to (statically) reverse it with Ghidra and what would be the next step in creating a full open source unlocker.
I also share a (hopefully) funny story about Mifare tags security practice.
