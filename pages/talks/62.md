## Better curl !
---

curl turned 21 tonight (time of submission) and it's EVERYWHERE. Let's dig further beyond -v.

1. Basics
2. POST, (fake)DNS, Cookies, protocols, errors
3. from the verbose to debug
4. curl writes C
5. ...roll your own ab/iplabel/avalanche - with better metrics, multithreaded, and really performant for 0$ in a few minutes. Live demo, hopefully no segfault
6. (optional) pipe it to numpy for some super cool graphs
7. Q&A
