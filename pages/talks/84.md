## TLS 1.3,  Solving new challenges for next generation firewalls
---


Transport layer security (TLS) version 1.3 has been standardized in August 2018 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This new version of the protocol focuses on enhancing user privacy and security. As a network and security appliance manufacturer, Stormshield's SNS (Stormshield Network Security) product provides security and application analysis over the previous versions of the TLS protocol (1.0 to 1.2). Service detection in our home-made Intrusion Prevention System for the TLS protocol is based on the server's certificate availability in the connection handshake. This certificate being now encrypted in TLS 1.3, its analysis requires solving new challenges. In this paper, we explain how we overcame these limitations, without downgrading the security level of the connection.
