## Improving your firmware security analysis process with FACT
---


Finding flaws in firmware can be like finding a needle in a haystack. Modern devices come equipped with a desktop sized operating system and a multitude of communication interfaces. The Firmware Analysis and Comparison Tool (FACT) streamlines the analysis process to reduce the initial analysis cost of an arbitrary firmware. It automates many time consuming and tedious steps such as unpacking, component identification, and basic static code analysis. FACT provides a queryable database for cross reference of firmware and security issues. The talk will offer a short introduction to the tool architecture, showing how it can be adapted and extended for specific use cases. The main focus will be a live demonstration of FACT and it's most useful features.
