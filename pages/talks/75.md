## Time-efficient assessment of open-source projects for Red Teamers
---


It is more and more common to face opensource projects during Red Team engagements. Due to time and efficiency constraints related to such assessments, it is always enjoyable to discover "quick-win" 0day vulnerabilities that will allow progressing in the intrusion and pivoting to critical networks or services. In this talk, we try to describe a methodology that allowed us to quickly discover numerous critical vulnerabilities in a widely-adopted project, GLPI. We will also discuss these findings and the security mechanisms that were implemented and how they were defeated.
