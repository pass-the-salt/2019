## D4 Project - Design and Implementation of an Open Source Distributed and Collaborative Security Monitoring
---


Building a large-scale network sensor can be a tedious task, the aim of the D4 Project is to make the creation and maintenance of such network simple and efficient. To reach the goal, the D4 project will develop open source components required to operate such network sensor and will live test the infrastructure with an DDoS and malicious activities sensor network deployed on a voluntary basis.
