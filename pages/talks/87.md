## Introduction to Osquery
---


Maintaining real-time insight into the current state of your endpoint infrastructure is crucial.  It is very important from operational, continuous security monitoring, and incident response perspective.  Created by Facebook in 2014, osquery is an open-source instrumentation framework for Windows, OS X (macOS), Linux, and FreeBSD operating systems.  

Osquery exposes the operating system as a relational database and allows you to write SQL queries to explore system data.  The generic SQL tables represent running processes, loaded kernel modules, open network connections, browser plugins, hardware events, file hashes, etc.  These SQL tables are implemented via an easy to extend API and several tables already exist and more are being written.  The main advantage of osquery is that it allows you to use one platform for monitoring complex operating system state across an entire infrastructure.  It has a high-performance and low-footprint distributed host monitoring daemon, osquery and also an interactive query console, called osqueryi.

During this two-hour workshop, we will learn about osquery's capabilities and cover the following topics:
- Osquery basics (installation, osqueryi, osqueryd, osquery schema);
- SQL refresher (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, LIKE, JOIN, etc.);
- Osquery configuration (flagfile, packs, schedule, logging, file integrity monitoring, etc.);
- Fleet management (Kolide Fleet, Doorman, SGT, etc.);
- Osquery extensions.

Technical requirements for the workshop:
- A laptop with at least 8 GB of RAM and 30-50 GB of free disk space;
- VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion or VMware Player installed.
