## Dexcalibur - automate your android app reverse
---


Have you ever been worried about wasting time to  make single-use hook in order to deobfuscate an Android app ?   Instrumentation techniques often require prior static analysis or a known generic method, and to read  a lot of code. Would you  like to generate dozens of hooks with a single click, gather the data and to sort it ?  Dexcalibur is a new tool with a GUI, an API, and is built on top of several tools (Frida, Baksmali, LIEF, Capstone, Smali VM, …). Its aim is to provide a way to  explore a view of the application built from static analysis (of the flat files and intercepted files at runtime) and data gathered from several instrumentation sessions. The idea : save time during analysis, keep focus on the security. 

In this talk  I propose to explain how Dexcalibur mixes static analysis, file analysis, and DBI in order to build a more complete view of the application.
