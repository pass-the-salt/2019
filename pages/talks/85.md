## Programming research,  a missed opportunity for secure and libre software?
---


We regret the lack of fruitful collaborations between free software
communities and *programming* research in academia (other sorts of
academic research, such as systems research and compilers research,
are better served). Programming errors, obviously, are one of the main
common source of security flaws in software, and most programming
research focuses on reducing them. Academia and free software have
long tradition of working together, yet Microsoft, Google and Facebook
take more advantage of programming research than most free software
communities!

Both sides (free software hackers and academia) have efforts to do to
improve this collaboration; this talk will focus on convincing free
software communities that this is a real problem that they should pay
attention to, and give illustrative examples of exciting projects that
do the right thing in this area. Improving this situation can have
very strong benefits on the quality of the free software that we
collectively build, share and use.
