You will find below the final report of the Pass the SALT 2019 conference, in which we will detail:
1. the **attendance**, 
2. the **exposure received by the conference**,
3. the **content** of the conference,
4. the **2019 speakers feedback**,
5. the **improvements made in 2019** following the feedback of the 2018 attendees, 
6. and finally, the **feedback from 2019 attendees**.


<div style="border-left: 5px solid green; padding-left: 10px"> <h2>SYNTHESIS</h2></div>

The TL;DR is there:

* **Content and sharing :** the conference was sold out (240 seats) and it allowed us to share high quality content about Security and Free Software without any restriction or barrier (**free entrance, streaming, slides and talks recording available online**). ![Thanks!](/img/thanks.png "Thanks")
* **Experience :** 97% of the attendees describe (through the post event survey) their experience as wonderful or very good.
* **Exchange :** a lot of new interactions between people coming from very different locations and backgrounds (professional, communities) have been made possible.

We really want to **thank you for your support which makes all of this possible!**

  * Conference reports: 
    * Xavier Mertens, DFIR expert: https://blog.rootshell.be/2019/07/04/pass-the-salt-2019-wrap-up/ “To conclude, three intense days with many talks (the fact that many of them were 20-mins talks, the schedule may contain more), relaxed atmosphere, good environment. It seems to be a “go” for the 2020 edition!”
