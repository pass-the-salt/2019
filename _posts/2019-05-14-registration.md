# Registration to Pass the SALT 2019 is open!

---

The registration will open May, 15th 2019 at 10:00 AM (UTC+2/Paris time).

Registration URL : [https://pretix.eu/passthesalt/2019/](https://pretix.eu/passthesalt/2019/)

200 seats are opened to the registration (+50 dedicated to speakers and org team).

<u>Some advices:</u>
* **Be fair**: Pass the SAL is a free (as in free beer) event and has a limited capacity (200 seats for attendees). So: 
    * **book a seat only if you are sure to come**! 
    * if after registration, it appears you can't finally come to the conference, **please cancel your order**.
* **Wifi**: Polytech school which hosts Pass the SALT will provide two kinds of wifi. 
    * A **limited wifi** (ie ~ only HTTP/HTTPS) wifi with shared creds: no action required on your side during registration to be able to access it. 
    * A **non filtered wifi with individual creds** : if you want this kind of wifi access, check the option during registration. Take care about the fact you will have to give your real name: we will push it and your email to Polytech school which, in return, will send you your creds.
