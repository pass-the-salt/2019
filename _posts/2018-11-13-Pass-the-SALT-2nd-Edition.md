# The second edition of Pass the SALT is coming!

---

After a successful first edition ([videos](https://passthesalt.ubicast.tv/channels/#2018), [slides](https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/files/talks/) and [survey](https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/feedback/)), Pass the SALT comes back in 2019. Same period, same place, new contents!

Memento:
- dates: July, 1 (afternoon) to 3 2019
- location: Lille, France. At the Polytech engineering school.

Next step: the openning of the call for paper, late December 2018 or early January 2019.

Hope (really) to hear you soon!
Mathieu, Christophe, CÃ©dric and Philippe
